We are, after all, not only her most attractive friends, but also her token liberal friends. She arranged our meeting and we clicked.</h3>
            <h3>Even though neither of us wanted to leap into anything too quickly, we definitely found ourselves spending more time together than apart. A year later, with a “yes” to a certain question, we find ourselves here and couldn’t be happier.</h3>

              <p>I am happy to have someone in my life with whom I can talk at length about everything and nothing…someone who gets me. I remind Liz how lucky she is to have me, but in reality, I am the fortunate one.</p>

              <p>Liz is very excited to be marrying Jeff! She has finally found herself a wonderful, intelligent, handsome man who can love and support her for who she is (and also feed her love of all things nerd)! While she thinks Star Trek is the best and Jeff thinks Harry Potter is most fabulous, both can agree that Star Wars is a happy medium to their nerdiness. Liz is looking forward to the many adventures she will have with Jeff, because life is just more fun with super heroes, wizards, The Force, and boldly going where no one has gone before!</p>

      <p class="lead-him">Best Man</p>
      <p>Kevin and Jeff have known each other for about a decade – much of that time as roommates. Kevin is somehow simultaneously Jeff’s conscience and mischief consultant. “He is one of the best people I know. Few people are lucky enough to have a friend like him,” according to Jeff.</p>

      <h2>Elaine Griffin</h2>
      <p class="lead-her">Maid of Honor</p>
      <p>Elaine and Liz have known each other since they started college (15 years now!!!). Elaine is the coordinated, artistic, musically inclined half to the friendship...which doesn't leave Liz with much, but Liz still loves her anyways.</p>

      <p class="lead-her">Matron of Honor</p>
      <p>Tabatha is the fierce friend Liz knows will always have her back and may do serious bodily harm to anyone who hurts her. Liz can’t help but love Tabby’s amazing optimism! Tabatha has been one of Liz's truest friends since the beginning.</p>

              <p class="lead-him">Best Man</p>
              <p>Patrick loves cars, peanut butter/honey crackers, and intellectual stuff.  He absolutely hates thin crust pizza and Michael's incessant jabbering.  When Patrick is not busy babysitting Michael on their wild adventures together he enjoys spending time plotting how he can make billions of dollars with his genius, engineering, entrepreneur skills, so one day he can buy Michael and Katie a yacht with helipad (and helicopter) like he promised.</p>

              <p>Catherine loves good beer, avocados, and local art.  She once punched a guy in grade school because he stole Katie's swing.  Ever since then she has been Katie's hero and they have been friends ever since.  When Catherine is not busy saving the world from swing thieves she works as a lawyer by day and a pinball hustler by night.</p>
